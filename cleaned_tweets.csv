The market seems to bear the sharp increases in Tesla prices and the loss of the federal tax credit. The remaining tax credit for other makes gives them a price umbrella that also benefits Tesla. Basing a buying choice on Musk behavior doesn‚Äôt seem rational.

This is why TSLA is worth 4 times more than all the other auto makers
Cope 100%. the reason he pulled out (for the first ever time in his live) is because the tesla stocks tanked and he did not have the money to by Twitter. Anyway I don't think he really wants it he's just a hype man after all. Elon in the planning room.

"Statistics doesn't like your tweet. 1 Tesla catches fire for every 210,000,000 miles driven.  Gas cars catch fire for every 19,000,000 miles driven.  Both are rare, Teslas catching fire is even more rare."

My tesla M3 2019 is available for test and you will see on one ride (1 hrs drive) that the car is trying to kill the driver by making dangerous maneuver! This is not even a joke and I have  witnesses!!1
"We have dangerous car on the road! 1- When a car passes me or a motorcycle is coming from the opposite direction, my M3 2019 swerves to the right. 2- A LOT OF PHANTOM BREAKING   Service center response: This is cause by radar, Remove emergency brake system!"
"99% of Tesla drivers are either shitty drivers, or drive like idiots. The positive from this is it makes it easy to avoid them on the road."
"Tesla has about -90% farther to fall. Tesla was first to market with an EV, but those days are over. Now the majors have EVs and the big kicker is they have newer and fresher looking designs. Tesla now needs to spend billions to retool just to give their EVs a face lift."

"According to University of Maryland researchers, of 1.4 million tweets between 2010 and 2020 from the 400 top accounts using Tesla‚Äôs stock ticker ($TSLA) , 23% seem to have come from bots.  Musk loves bots.  If you think otherwise, you‚Äôre ignorant."

"Normies think this vindicates the co2 causes climate change narrative, but it doesn't. They have simply engineered drought. It's very elementary basic science like free energy or anything else Tesla achieved at the Chicago Fair of 1893."
"Trying to gauge bot percentage from your own experience is not gonna work. Even if a bot spams hundreds or thousands of times per day it's still just one user. And they target the gullible ones - so crypto, meme stonk and tesla fan boys get more than their fair share of bot spam."

Elon Musk didn‚Äôt establish or found Tesla.   He is a liar.  Tesla was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003. Elon joined late afterwards.   This idea that it‚Äôs his creation is a total lie. So South Africans asking for Eskom help from Elon aren‚Äôt well informed.
I just published Elon Musk Is Withdrawing From the Twitter Transaction After Selling $8 Billion in Tesla (Tsla)‚Ä¶

"This is an expensive hobby! When Musk¬†pretended¬†in 2018¬†that he was going to¬†take Tesla Inc. private, he had to pay the US Securities and Exchange Commission¬†a $20 million fine¬†and stop being the chairman of Tesla‚Äôs board."
"Edison tried hard to discredit Tesla. He secretly financed the electric chair that used AC to ""prove"" how dangerous AC was. He also tortured animals publicly using AC. He even filmed an elephant being electrocuted in 1903.  This is the hero that they tell you about in school..."
Tesla licensed the patents to Westinghouse for $60K and also received stock and royalties. Westinghouse hired him as a consultant for $2K a month which is the equivalent of over $50K today.  The war of currents began...
"In 1887, Tesla invented an induction motor (run on AC) and it was the most efficient one that it is still used today. A version of it powers 's vehicles that took its name from the inventor, and its logo from his motor."
"After losing his company, Tesla had to take a job digging ditches for $2 a day just to survive."
"Tesla quit and started his own electric company in 1885, but investors showed little interest and decided to take the company and all of Tesla's patents."
Tesla and Jeep? Yasss queen
"One time, a manager at Edison's company offered Tesla a $50,000 bonus if he could improve some machines that ran on DC. When he did, he wasn't paid and Edison told him: ""You don't understand our American humor."""
Great work
Tesla was a fan of AC while Edison preferred DC. AC can be transmitted over large distances and this is why it is used today in our homes.
"In 1884, Tesla‚Äôs manager offered him a job at Edison‚Äôs Machine Works in NYC. He agreed and arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket after he was stolen."

Tesla had a beautiful mind; he could perform calculus in his head and spoke 8 languages. He was a good student at the start but would not finish school...
"But Tesla was interested in engineering. When he contracted cholera as a teen, and nearly died, his father promised to send him to engineering school if he survived... And miraculously, he did!"
All just cover for him to sell Tesla stock
"Tesla credits his mother, ƒêuka Mandiƒá, for his interest in invention. His father was a priest and wanted him to become one too."

Tesla died alone and broke. He lived off a diet of warm milk and crackers and was obsessed with feeding the pigeons outside. One of the greatest inventors of all time faded into obscurity and died penniless. The reason will become clear by the end of this thread.

"Apple just continued producing, kept market share dominance &amp; kept high prices.  Only difference is marketing.  Tesla doesn't even have a PR department. Think about how well their sales will be if (when) they do get one.   Tesla will overtake Apple as the world's largest stock."

"It‚Äôs not about the amount of money in the world. Inflation is driven by higher demand than supply. If a Tesla car costs $100K and everyone is billionaire, everyone can afford it which drives demand and supply can‚Äôt keep up which in turn the car price will have to increase."
Tesla obviously
"Sure you can lol  He made his money by sheer luck: he was at PayPal early and had a ton of stock even though they fired him   Also, almost his entire wealth is paper: it's all Tesla stock. And he bought Tesla, he didn't found it.  It's easy to make money if you start with money"

You really goal post moving. You initially brought up supply chain issues for why they haven't even produced a truck they announced in 2016 while others produced and delivered in same time frame.  Tesla has produced 1.91 million cars since 2009 not in last few yrs as you claim.
