"I figured it as part of the “Tesla Premium” built into cost of the vehicle.  And since I am told that the whole reason to have a EV  is that next to nobody drives more than 300 miles in a day, ergo the network is an highly under utilized up front subscription."
Tesla down 6% already
"Let's start a thread listing all the businesses, both big and small, that accepts  and then retweet and post this to the community on Twitter and Reddit to help and encourage  Utility.  I'll start with the obvious:  - Tesla - The Boring Company  - AMC Theaters"

"Twitter could, in effect, end up owning Tesla and SpaceX"
"The new car market is around 60 Million. If Tesla managed to sell 10 Million of robotaxis, it would still generate plenty of revenue without total car sales going up."
"Elon Musk doesn't understand that a child's parent needs affordable housing, healthcare, medicine, college, and child care. Non of those things are affordable in the USA. But it seems that Elon Musk doesn't care because he is rich and can afford those things 💰."
That's the reason why you have many wives?

Tesla investors are right to not trust you
Children are essential to the future
Yep. Dude is a basic troll pretending to be hot shit cause he invested in a company he didn't start. 😂  This man tried to lie that tesla was a shell and they had no IP at all before he came. He actually claimed he was an original founder.
using chuck norris name like teslas tao disgrace your own ineptitude gtfoh your a musk not even close tao a tesla go hang out with eric dollard u bitter old white gremlin in your panties technocratic flushing gushing
Alternate view-Tesla report results July 20 that will show billions in losses. Every article mentioned musk never said where his proportion of the $ was going to come from. He did sell 8.5 billion in Tesla stock which this scam provided cover for. 101 P/E ratio for Tesla stock?!!

"Tesla also has several women suing the company for the harassment they experienced inside the company. His Neuralink IACUC Committee wrote a protest letter to the US govt on Elon's insistence upon unnecessary animal mistreatment. Notice the emphasis on the word UNNECESSARY""."
"Call it a “rail” if you want, as dumb as that is, but it’s still operating in the real world and dealing with edge cases. You think if Tesla has a robotaxi fleet they will be able to operate on their own at all times with no ability for Tesla to take over? Are you that thick?"
The market seems to bear the sharp increases in Tesla prices and the loss of the federal tax credit. The remaining tax credit for other makes gives them a price umbrella that also benefits Tesla. Basing a buying choice on Musk behavior doesn’t seem rational.
Being a parent to those kids is also essential
Man I have no clue why it's not on most cars. It's a cheap thing for them to add and it makes the experience so much nicer. I think it's something I would add on myself if I got a Tesla or something.

You're talking bad about Tesla
The same people that want to suck him off when it’s Tesla talk. Lib logic is fascinating.
"You signed an agreement with Twitter, waving the due diligence on Twitter accounts. Then you learned that the funding would jeopardize Tesla/SpaceX shares and looked for an excuse to back out. We all know that Twitter is full of bots and I am quite sure you knew that too."
And a Tesla
What you can’t seem to grasp is that it’s a safety concern if cruise cannot communicate or navigate the vehicle if something goes wrong. Your idea that Tesla will have this system that can do whatever it wants wherever without any central control is fucking idiotic
Not when there is going to be a shortage of food and water.
We should switch to the metric system.  For the love of god.  Please.
It's called corruption. A lot of big investors want to see Tesla fail. It will be funny when these companies lose tonnes of money from shorting Tesla.
He didn't buy cuz the Tesla stock tanked

Great 💕
I love Tesla but that 150 top speed for most of their cars just ain’t it
I knew he had personal power motives. And I’m sure he would like to make Tesla a monopoly of his own. I never really had a problem with him till he started spouting off ridiculous statements on Twitter just before he made the purchase deal.

Did Elon Musk FAKE Twitter Deal To Distract From Tesla Stock Chaos? Baty...   via
How about you make the world a better place for kids? That way bothers would feel better about bringing a kid into this world.
Tesla is a fabrication created to hide the origins of technology he is credited for creating
"That's dumb.  Tesla and SpaceX are both major contributions to humankind and neither would be what they are without Musk.  Is he also an asshole?  Yep.  But for all his trolling and sure, degeneracy, he's still a major force for good overall."
"Dude… you must not get out a lot💀. Literally traveled cross country, and there were plenty of Tesla’s from other states, where you wouldn’t think to see them 😂😂 you gotta have lead in your head or something"
That’s a bold take
"Great article! I have little girl who are brilliant, still going public school, can't afford take her to gifted school. Wealth people can take kids to better education and get rich."
What would help me sleep would be to get the spare parts for my Tesla Model 3. I've been waiting for them for 8 months.
"The future of work, the future of automobiles, and the future of free speech — at the nexus point of all of these is Elon Musk. Dig in with us:"
What are Tesla’s maternity and paternity leave benefits? Are they among the best in the world?
"I have been saying the same, but the train has left the station now on EV. Thinking that these traditional manufacturers don’t have the resources, know how, to take it to Tesla once they make the decision to get serious about it, is just hubris. Competition is a good thing."
"Because of the efficiencies of an electric motor, it can be 100% powered by coal produced electricity and it’s still 2x-3x more environmentally friendly. (Tesla gets the equivalent of 120mpg)"
How about Tesla and most high-end cars that record all the time?

Every child's important to the Future no matter what color or race. People need to start remembering we're all human beings and deserve the right to live and be treated as such. Here's an idea though why don't we try worrying about the ones that are already born and alive. JS.
Let us first talk about the present Elon!. Cost of living is too high. People are choosing not to have kids...

I believe $Tsla is down today because Vanguard and Blackrock are the 2 top investors in $Twtr and got rugged by Musk. They’re pulling their shares out of Tesla.  They know that’s the easiest way to get to him hopefully triggering a margin call in the 500’s.

You're on the internet I assume you can use Google. Tesla paid zero in federal corporate tax factually. They did so by creating overseas companies and then claiming that the overseas companies make all the profits. It's a tax loophole that needs fixing.

Yes and the irony here is that the prediction wasn't even made by them. The source is clearly printed at the bottom. This is one of the strangest criticisms I've seen of ML so far.
Imagine everyone acting out this philosophy and the world dies out very soon.
"Check out the Tesla impact assessment document on their website. It’s less than 6,000 miles on average world grid electricity which is dirtier than UK electricity. Like a lot of EV manufacturers their factories are carbon neutral unlike ICE factories."
"Any female (or male) MFTs out there looking to breed children, Benson’s Cho is free for use"
Dude wear a condom- stick to one relationship- don’t make an excuse that we are underpopulated- which we are not for your lack of sexual responsibility

2/ Tesla could still sell 10-20M vehicles/year if total auto ownership declines. Why? Because avg. annual auto sales ≠ auto ownership. The total auto fleet will begin to turn over faster as robotaxi fleets roll out and existing ICE vehicles become increasingly obsolete.
what’s the plan for us Tesla fans to be in touch with you if Twitter bans you? $TSLA
which one is your other account?

Nope. That's not the only variable.

Also stock price action would suggest the latest fatal Tesla accident was indeed Autopilot or FSD. Also means that Tesla still cannot distinguish the difference between a bridge overhang and a tractor trailer yet Elon Musk has failed to fix or disclose this fact. Gross Negligence

lol please Don’t have a lot of kids if you’re poor. Elon &amp; other rich people can be this careless because they can afford it. Not smart idea for regular folks. The rich get richer &amp; that’s the future for the amount of kids any wealthy person bring into this world.

No children possible with baby mamas. Make sure they are taken care of 😉
ok you are right dear AI
But it's not enough to make more kids Chief.  The parent(s) need to be able to support them well &amp; raise them responsibly.  The world does not need kids starving physically or emotionally....
What about their educational Elon? What can we do about improving that. ?!
I always felt lost and some degree of anxiety when not expecting… 🤷‍♀️
"Tesla should SERIOUSLY consider coming out with a line of micro-trucks for off-road / farm / private land use. Then offer a variety of DC operated tools and hardware made to run off the available power supply, or a stand-off battery."

Not after we cure aging.
Agree.   Don't stop the population.  Work for humanities
Musk didn't have the money to buy Twitter. He leveraged his Tesla stock &amp; went searching for Angel Investors. Musk actually isn't even a billionaire in liquid cash

Hello love😂😂🔞
"Lmfao he did this to be able to dump Tesla. It’s not complicated and Twitter called his bluff. They’re all evil assholes anyway, so who cares."
They said you have to disclose your public company stock purchase  You didn't disclose your stock purchase  You set a price and made a bold claim to increase your share price and then tried to back out getting to dump Tesla too  You committed securities fraud  FTFY
And don’t look at Tesla’s stock price
Children are essential to the future
And Elon will be the one to tank Tesla  ... While every other car company surpasses them with their evs

"Tesla hired an incremental 1,000 employees for🇩🇪 Giga Berlin the Federal Agency of Work informed   650 people have been hired who have been registered as unemployed before. Those people have usually a hard time finding a job"
Tell that to the fucking parents
What do you think of adoption Elon

You can tell the Tesla investors that have faith on what is coming. All Smiles!!!!
"Bro, I'm good"
"If I have to turn up my thermostat and unplug major appliances, then Tesla owners need to unplug their cars."
Doesn’t happen to modern EV’s either. Big problem was resistive heating and poor thermal management. The Plaid Tesla uses a heat pump and an entirely new pack design that eliminates most of those issues.

"And on top of that, starting any kind of car company is extemely hard. Most auto manufacturers are many decades old for that reason. Operating requires a lot of infrastructure other industries don’t. And Tesla really built it at scale too. That in itself is impressive."
Looking forward to all-EV races.

"Actually yes! Capitalism is a growth-based economy in which our civilization relies upon ... this sadly require an ever increasing amount of the working population to counterbalance the ""financial/labour burden"" of modern high-life expectancy"
Yes children are essential to the future along with the quality of life and love they are given.   Many are starving and living  war in  zones.  I cannot believe you use under population to justify your actions.   That is selfishness!
There will be no future without them!! procreate 👏🏻procreate👏🏻 procreate 👏🏻
But they are a lifetime commitment and can do a lifetime of damage to other people so take that decision very seriously!
Absolutely. But here we have a culture of hatred toward children.
"Vehicle autonomy will save many lives while making it possible to greatly expand walking, biking and other forms of personal mobility. Kind of important. None of it means you need to buy a Tesla, of course."

Amazing company but being brought down by Elon himself with his tweets… if he stops tweeting for a year Tesla will be much better off
Tesla is the leader in overpriced and unreliable vehicles.
He could spend have done a random sample of his own profile and seen it’s clearly 50% bots at least. He doesn’t seem to mind the bots when they share pro Tesla and Musk content or attack his foes.

My kids answer will be different then mine 🤷🏼‍♂️
Tesla will be like Blackberry.
What a terrible example. You know that tesla has FAR less sales/revenue than most major auto companies right? But its market cap according to its stock price is more than the 5 biggest auto companies combined?

Probably because they are much cheaper and can be worked on by more places.... Tesla is like Apple 🍎 a closed loop system that is all about stasus without considering that it's the common person who will dominate the market not the elite unless they want to become common.

"Twitter has been overvalued stock for a long time and Elon exposing the bot problem is only proving that more. And considering tesla up'd their production by 25% from last Q2 even w/ supply chain shortages, I'd say that matters a lot more than a couple distasteful tweets."
No surprises here. Pretty rare to find some one who didn't already know it was a stunt so he could sell off 20b of Tesla stock without panicking the market. He never intended to buy anything.

There are good reasons to be bearish on Tesla especially when it was the 1200.  Expecting 50% growth is not obvious.  What I don't get are the people who value Tesla at a 10 PE on TTM.
It will work in his favor in court. Cannot say that Musk didn't take steps to raise  finance in the face of Tesla crashing.

"I’m so sick of people born into fortunes acting like they’ve done anything in life. He didn’t invent Tesla nor any of their tech. He invested in the Tesla company that already existed. He’s not a genius; his dad just exploited Africa, &amp; left Elon a fortune to play pretend with."

Interesting $TSLA is disconnected from TESLA current growth rate. Even Q2 2022 TESLA is still growing unlike most automakers. Q3 and Q4 2022 growth will be parabolic. So eventually $TSLA will have to reflect TESLA growth. Haters say overvalued 90ish P/E  after Q2 70ish P/E

Tesla founder Elon Musk is laughing off Twitter's move to sue him over his decision to drop his $44 billion purchase of the social network.
So just wondering…with Tesla stock plummeting what is his current value again? Serious question. Not trying to do a “gotcha moment” or anything.
He’s a narcissist who likes and needs attention. He also damaged the branding and the value of his other companies SpaceX and Tesla by his antics. Tesla used to have Apple like aura around its electric cars. No more.
his firm wouldn't be here without coordinate fraud i.e. Archegos Capital and Tesla

This is why TSLA is worth 4 times more than all the other auto makers
Cope 100%. the reason he pulled out (for the first ever time in his live) is because the tesla stocks tanked and he did not have the money to by Twitter. Anyway I don't think he really wants it he's just a hype man after all. Elon in the planning room.

"I have driven my car 100k miles w 0 maintenance of any kind.  The ratings are a result of Tesla not having a 50+ yr relationship with the rate-ers.  the build quality is fantastic and I could link Munro saying so, can you link where he says he ""takes it easy on Tesla""?"
"my greed is not bearish.  i just have a hard time believing that we've seen the end of the 3AC/Terra Collapse.  Tesla underwater on their holdings, MtGox unlocks.  The strategy is max ETH accumulation.   I just want cheap af prices. dont sue me."

😂 I just bought my 2nd Tesla.
Closed $TSLA $730 Put position. It's holding near $700 at the time. It could go to $700 or bounce back to $750. I wasn't sure that's why I sold.

"Musk in new trouble, complains to everyone: ""We are losing billions on the new Tesla gigafactories"". but the gentleman doesn't complain to anyone when he collects billions of $$$$$$$$$$$$$, he hurts everyone!!"
Tesla never got beat in sales as advertised from China. SMH. Do your research. 🤦
"Just keep Tesla stock strong, please…."
"I’m a Tesla bill btw I just added but adding in ah on circus hype, you deserve to get crushed. Good luck everyone."
"What's hilarious is watching Elon lose more money every day. His plant in Germany on shut-down, his stock tanking, Tesla cars bring recalled and a death trap, and he's almost as big a laughing stock in the world as Trump. But his trolling is apparently top notch. 🤡"
Not good. Tesla battery ignites at a wrecking yard 3 weeks (!) after a crash.
"It’s probably because your Tesla stock crashed, and you can’t afford it anymore. Try sticking to the truth."
"Do you own a non-Tesla electric car? Well, you may be able to start using Tesla superchargers very, very soon.   Read all about it here:"

Congratulations brother!

I can’t be agree more with you Gary! Tesla is a movement. It’s like a kind of a hidden soft future government which will be managing future financial systems (by cryptocurrency) &amp; managing the mass population by its Twitter media communications!
The Lucid Air is a FAST car.  The Tesla Plaid uses TELEPORTATION!   😈
"The tesla model 3 is the lightest tesla available and still weighs 1,000 pounds more than my hyundai elantra and weighs the same as my moms santa fe which is a dreaded SUV."
"Twitter (TWTR) stock down, Tesla (TSLA) up after Musk walks"
7-1. Neither Tesla nor Twitter can absorb the loss should they fight this joke of a deal until the end.
Tesla Model S Plaid it is!
it was always the plan  Musk is losing Tesla and he needed the stock boost.  he never intended  to buy twitter.
You know much more about Tesla than I do. What’s behind the Grünheide shut down for two weeks and the growing unrest among the workforce about unequal pay? I read this on German news. Any truth to this?
"Tesla is always down more than Nasdaq with a x1.5 to 2 Beta, it’s normal. But again, Gary’s tweet doesn’t isn’t something affecting the WHOLE MARKET."
"Drunk driver hit my Tesla yesterday head-on, he’s in EMS while I walked out, shout-out  and Tesla’s 5 star safety (and sentry mode cameras) $tsla $qqq $spy"
And it goes without saying that: He should focus on running Tesla and SpaceX instead of trying to be a one-man solution to the low birthrate problem…
"Yes… I live in Texas   I am fully aware   I also, am a Farmer, with my own energy and food, so I don’t really need to worry about that, Tesla batteries are great  Maybe that’s why they are trying to get rid of us on a global scale"

"Trump slated the Tesla and SpaceX CEO  over his botched Twitter deal  Trump also recalled how Musk allegedly 'told me he voted for me,' only to recently claim he is not sure he ever voted for a Republican"
Twitter stock fell Monday after Tesla chief Elon Musk ditched a $44-billion deal to buy the social media giant.
What does your ownership of Tesla vehicles have to do with this topic ?
"⏩ loud Tatsuki woman...Tesla...  ""Some pink haired woman, the spouse of another...you...is being courted by...more...you's..."" 💧He clears his throat.  ""That human woman with black hair is causing trouble and loudly venting her dating woes, and it seems the Quinta's Fracción ⏩"
"I didn’t say he didn’t intend to buy $TWTR, just that it was - and probably still is - a means to an end. Which remains selling a block of $TSLA without it appearing it’s about Tesla."
It is.  But time for a facelift.  Usually you’ll see changes to the front end.  Update to the style.  It’s time.
Look at musk he’s an idiot and he’s trying to blame Twitter for it but he died in Tesla and everything else and he also was firing all those at Tesla and Twitter and he is loyal to the dark side to side with the republican party mask is a loser.
"High rolling resistance(big grippy tyres) and aero will both hurt range. Hard to judge these things, but I do think they should buy Tesla plaid motors for their cars.."
Even yoda cannot save Tesla
Wake up  when have time ! Let’s work and grow up!
Sir...can u explain the innovation done by your company in automobile sector..like fr example Tesla brought electric..plz let us know
is this a new pose for baby Tesla?😄😄😄😄
"Bear flag🚩🤣 ,  📉"
"Agreed. He says hes not buying, share price drops, twitter sues and he gets the info all while Tesla price gets a bump. he sells tesla stock at the higher price and buys twitter at a lower price. EZ"
Just in case you cant read lips from too much tesla sperm in your eyes....he says 'Go back to your home on WHORE island!'
Are you kidding? Munro even admitted he goes easy on Tesla because he has a financial stake in the company. All Tesla’s still have widespread build quality and reliability problems. That’s why the company keeps coming in at the bottom of reliability rankings.

Anyone knows what happening with Tesla app for devices? Cos not responding since Friday!  $MOOO
"Almost 10 years and still going strong, impressive."
He built this car to massage his ego. He didn’t want Tesla to beat him with the Roadster.
Exciting to see it compare to Tesla Roadster Space X Edition.
"No. You can't buy one. You can order it. As demand for EVs ramps up, only Tesla has the capacity to deliver and still be profitable."
I’d bet on Elons lawyers over Twitters; probably a reduce break up fee. Overall bullish for Tesla if they did this deal Tesla would have been in serious trouble due to a possible Musk margin call scenario
This whole part of the country is pretty light. I really want to see one between KC and Lake Ozark. Either Tesla or CCS.  :(
"Yes, the workmanship of the interior is very rich, Tesla is really like a beggar version"
A Tesla bro being this misinformed....imagine my shock
Doesn’t seem tesla specific. The whole markets take a dump right now. At least tech is. But I assume other markets too.

"Btw he got his millions with only 20,000 - initially      best car fkn ever"
Moving Tesla from California to Texas with its broken power grid is as dumb as trying to buy Twitter.
Awesome! More German jobs creation!
Fantastic ❤️‍🔥🤟🥰
His new fan base didn’t buy enough Tesla stock.
"Just went on a road trip with the 3, and was thinking, It would be awesome if Tesla had its own travel stops, similar to gas stations but instead have charging stations, restrooms, snacks, drinks, and Tesla merch! Some of the super charger locations on our trip were in odd places"
"Twitter's stock has dropped 20.4% year to date, while Tesla shares have shed 31.9% and the S&amp;P 500 index has declined 19.1%.   $TWTR $TSLA $TSLAQ. Thanks,"
Is it fast?
No Gary. Tesla is down today 100% because of macro
"Awww Julia. I’m so sorry. Definitely try and move about as much as you can. Walk in the fresh air. Diana knows what to do for sure. Drink plenty of fluids, too. You got this. 🤗"
"""Volume seven of Tesla Speaks announced the existence of the great Intergalactic Confederation Project that was sending a spacefleet to earth before December 1974. When no flying saucers arrived, the date was reset to 27 September 1975. This date also was disconfirmed,"
"Yeah sure, that was your plan all along bro. More like you never wanted to go through with the deal and it was all a smokescreen for dumping much of your overvalued Tesla Stock before the market crashed."
who the hell wrote nikola tesla was serbian-american on wikipedia 💀
Testing light version of Tesla 😆
There is no reason at all for it to be down - except the big boys want to make their money on driving market down instead of up now - but Tesla will prevail and pull up.
There are too many Tesla drivers in Texas for us to be without electricity.
Are you that anti-Elon that you think this is a smart comment? Do you know what a Tesla recall looks like?  99% of it is an over-the-air software update. They aren't 'recalled' or 'replaced' or 'brought in for service.' It installs the fix while you're sleeping.
"Yes, from a plethora of automakers that are continuing to expand production.  Tesla's creating an ouroboros by laying people off the same time their delivery rate is declining&amp;they'll use the ouroboros to justify perpetual price hikes (as we've seen already)"
Butts in seats is all it takes
He sold $8.5 billion in Tesla stock quietly while pretending to buy Twitter loudly.   Sham.
My bestie.    Tesla legends  Elon
"He cannot afford it, which is why he had some much leverage that was going to be staked by other parties.  He would have to sell a ton of Tesla which would crash its stock and take down all of his leverage that he has in the stock."
Always there is an excuse for any drop in tesla price and always has to do with elon !  Why they can't accept the fact that tesla fair price should not exceed 400$! The fast they do the less pain they will suffer

xD that dude announced the Tesla Semi in 2017 and wanted to release it 2019. Still no sign that it would be released every. And Elon fans still think that this guy is a Genius. Just because he got kicked out of Paypal and kept is shares...
So you're saying Tesla discovered lightning?

So funny thing about this guy - he picked me up in Scottsdale in a  and we start talking about ⁦⁩ and ⁦⁩ and  in he pulls out his phone shows me his  stocks he has millions of dollars in Tesla and is  for way more 💎👏
"But he wants a Tesla?  Oh, I see. This was just a “I’ve got an AMG” post."
Tesla stock has one good year in 2020 and people like you think it’s a strong stock
Happy Birthday to Nikola Tesla. The greatest scientist of all time.

Success != perfection. Weren’t there lots of near miss bailouts (including from his brother) in Tesla

Think it has nothing to do with $TSLA or $TWTR - good $TWTR dark cloud is out of the way - however as market and Tesla has rallied off the lows it is taking a breather here - sellers come in and usually selling high beta names harder such as $TSLA ..
Elon will fail if he tries to start his own social network and I’m a big Elon/tesla supporter.

Same here.
They sure can do rolling black outs but why not shut off the Tesla charger pumps! Smdh!
"My mother in law's HOA president bought a tesla, installed a charger without approval now HO Ins went up $60,000 a year. She posted a vague meeting with a past date to show that the rest of the residents approve of the hyke rate. Florida has the worst HOA."
And he had no idea that was happening when he made the offer?  Is he that sloppy of a businessman ( Tesla  was built on government subsidies).

"Explain me how was Tesla green at the beginning of the day when market was already tanking, no need for insults boy"
You should do a poll asking us whether we think you are undervaluing or overvaluing the impact of Twitter on tesla
He has his mission and he has his vision of stonks and the market and quite frankly if   + others are correct.. I’m hoping  he will buy as much back as possible then .When it falls .  PS It’s killing me to hold millions out of tesla in cash
"Statistics doesn't like your tweet. 1 Tesla catches fire for every 210,000,000 miles driven.  Gas cars catch fire for every 19,000,000 miles driven.  Both are rare, Teslas catching fire is even more rare."
"To your point , on taking delivery first time,maybe let the ‘seasonal’ Tesla Representative hand you a cold soft drink, get you into your new Tesla and give you the option of an AI driven guided tour/tutorial on the screen while you’re in a safe environment on site?"
This puts more stress on the car e.g higher probability of warranty claims. So I think its fine. No gasoline car runs at full spec otherwise chip tuning would not be a thing.
Including “ Car carrier carrying Tesla's catches on fire” so includes diesel fires? Wonder if there is a worldwide petrol car fire website?

My tesla M3 2019 is available for test and you will see on one ride (1 hrs drive) that the car is trying to kill the driver by making dangerous maneuver! This is not even a joke and I have  witnesses!!1

Yeah but EV's currently only make up about 4.6% of cars in the US and Tesla is only about 75% of that so that's not saying much. Once the people in power get their way and EV's are closer to 50% or more of all cars in the US we're going to be in some serious trouble.

You are the one whit problems stating that Tesla SC is only for Tesla maybe in the US not in Europe. Soon they open in the hole world. Musk last interview he sad that they are burning cash and have since laid of a lot of people.

"Keep in mind, I know Tesla's math... as well as Vortex math... I am a seeker and calculator of statistical probabilities, and I do so within ten seconds of accuracy with the correct data and time to gain insight."

I agree. They are just extremely cheaply made.
In that context I am also thinking tax play. I believe if he invests the money in another company he would not actually need to pay takes on his Tesla stock sales. So maybe he's been on the hunt for something.

Looks like we'll be testing out our  batteries today.

At this point figure the whole twitter thing was what at least one analyst has reported. A way for him to cash out a large chuck of Tesla options without making it look like odd insider trades. Then his public behavior had folks dropping Tesla stock anyway.

FSD will be safer than human in 3-5 years max. It’s not very dangerous.  You ca use it in certain condition  and it’s safe.  I see people seat in the backseat of the car and film them self or even sleep. Thats have nothing to do with Tesla.

Oof interesting take. Getting a Tesla was arguably one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. ~10k miles. $0 spent on charging since it’s free in my building.
Yes... wel the companies wallet. 😂  Funniest thing I got asked in the last few months: Older guy asked me how it is possible that he saw a Tesla with Norwegian plates in Italy. He was really serious. Just entered Rome into ther navigation and he got it. Media BS ftw.

Uh. It takes 15 minutes to get to 80% charge (about 200 miles). I don’t think I’ve spent more than 30 minutes at any one public charger. Sooo why would someone leave their car at a public charger for 8 hours?

Musk uses Twitter’s greed and “free speech” to cash in $9 billion of Tesla shares at their peak.  Knowing full well both shares are way overvalued. Thus turning his funny money into reality. And dangling that carrot in front of Twitter. Who jumped at it.  There never was a deal.
In how many time? and... looking at other messages... when (Kms.) you needed to change the battery? It was under guarantee period?

I had a dream that Nikola Tesla invented animatronics 🤷🏼‍♀️
Even worse. Imagine idolizing this clown or thinking he is some sort of great businessman. Super leader has done nothing but tank the stock value of both Tesla and twitter since he started mucking around. Literally the job of a ceo is to drive value and he’s driven it down

I haven't asked Tesla tbh. But have to calle them anyway. So I'll ask.
The reason is because Tesla was not a capitalist. He made decisions that those with more business acumen would not have made. He wasn't concerned about money. He was concerned about the pursuit of Science for the betterment of humanity. He wanted to change the world and he did.
Is Tesla leading the way in a new assault on the motor insurance market by electric vehicle manufacturers?
That's definitely necessary. Got a speeding ticket recently because AP started braking at the sign and not before. And the slowdown at the sign is not Strong enough atm
It should scare incumbents when a decade of pushing telematics devices has yielded low adoption and Tesla makes it table stakes in just under a year. Continues to sound like a distribution and trust problem that's limiting this stuff getting into more vehicles.

This left Tesla in financial ruin. He had no choice but to abandon his dream project in 1905 and lost Wardenclyffe Tower to foreclosure.

"Despite this, good things were happening for Tesla and Westinghouse. They underbid Edison and his company to illuminate the World's Colombian Exposition in Chicago in 1893. It became clear to the 27 million people who attended that AC is the future."

"Normies think this vindicates the co2 causes climate change narrative, but it doesn't. They have simply engineered drought. It's very elementary basic science like free energy or anything else Tesla achieved at the Chicago Fair of 1893."
"Trying to gauge bot percentage from your own experience is not gonna work. Even if a bot spams hundreds or thousands of times per day it's still just one user. And they target the gullible ones - so crypto, meme stonk and tesla fan boys get more than their fair share of bot spam."

Both Tesla and Spacex owe their existence to Barack Obama who funded both these companies when they were about to close shop and shut down forever.   But this South African asshole now berates Obama’s party &amp; praises Trump’s party.   He now hates government funding also. A Trumpy
Elon Musk didn’t establish or found Tesla.   He is a liar.  Tesla was founded by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning in 2003. Elon joined late afterwards.   This idea that it’s his creation is a total lie. So South Africans asking for Eskom help from Elon aren’t well informed.
I just published Elon Musk Is Withdrawing From the Twitter Transaction After Selling $8 Billion in Tesla (Tsla)…
"Elon Musk is walking away from Twitter deal after selling $8 billion worth of Tesla (TSLA) stock for it   by   —   () Jul 11, 2022"
"This is an expensive hobby! When Musk pretended in 2018 that he was going to take Tesla Inc. private, he had to pay the US Securities and Exchange Commission a $20 million fine and stop being the chairman of Tesla’s board."
"Edison tried hard to discredit Tesla. He secretly financed the electric chair that used AC to ""prove"" how dangerous AC was. He also tortured animals publicly using AC. He even filmed an elephant being electrocuted in 1903.  This is the hero that they tell you about in school..."
Tesla licensed the patents to Westinghouse for $60K and also received stock and royalties. Westinghouse hired him as a consultant for $2K a month which is the equivalent of over $50K today.  The war of currents began...
"In 1887, Tesla invented an induction motor (run on AC) and it was the most efficient one that it is still used today. A version of it powers 's vehicles that took its name from the inventor, and its logo from his motor."
"After losing his company, Tesla had to take a job digging ditches for $2 a day just to survive."
"Tesla quit and started his own electric company in 1885, but investors showed little interest and decided to take the company and all of Tesla's patents."
Tesla and Jeep? Yasss queen
"One time, a manager at Edison's company offered Tesla a $50,000 bonus if he could improve some machines that ran on DC. When he did, he wasn't paid and Edison told him: ""You don't understand our American humor."""
Great work
Tesla was a fan of AC while Edison preferred DC. AC can be transmitted over large distances and this is why it is used today in our homes.
"In 1884, Tesla’s manager offered him a job at Edison’s Machine Works in NYC. He agreed and arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket after he was stolen."

Tesla had a beautiful mind; he could perform calculus in his head and spoke 8 languages. He was a good student at the start but would not finish school...
"But Tesla was interested in engineering. When he contracted cholera as a teen, and nearly died, his father promised to send him to engineering school if he survived... And miraculously, he did!"
All just cover for him to sell Tesla stock
"Tesla credits his mother, Đuka Mandić, for his interest in invention. His father was a priest and wanted him to become one too."
"Tesla began seeing visions and flashes of light since he was a child. This helped him in imagining the invention first, and then building it."

"Tesla was born in the town of Smiljan, in present day Croatia on July 10, 1856, during a fierce lightning storm. According to family legend, the midwife said: “This child will be a child of darkness”. To which his mother replied: “No. He will be a child of light.”"
Tesla died alone and broke. He lived off a diet of warm milk and crackers and was obsessed with feeding the pigeons outside. One of the greatest inventors of all time faded into obscurity and died penniless. The reason will become clear by the end of this thread.

He literally bought in to Tesla using PayPal money and forced them to call him a founder. The only notable patent he was credited with a hand in was a fkn proprietary charging port that makes it non-universal. Dude is a daddy’s money hack.
We still don’t have the full picture here. But customers are being used as lab rats for a tech that Tesla doesn’t know if they’ll make it better than 2170 yet. I’m surprised 4680 came out like this. Maybe this is a way to avoid the Osborne effect.

Unfortunately we’ll need to start at lowest common denominator and then start increasing speeds over time. I already worry when overtaking a Tesla driving on the autobahn at 130km/h relative to me at 200+ that the SW can’t handle that speed difference

How Elon’s bizarre Twitter takeover saga could have just been a cover for him to sell $8.5 billion in Tesla stock   ...This Maggott has lied many many times before.  I'd like to see Trump terrorize him for awhile.
"Not growing anywhere near fast enough here in Australia sadly. Tesla are selling cars like crazy here, including over 10k model Y orders in 2 days when they opened up in June. But we have barely had any new SCs in the last couple of years."
I could really see the Vatican operating.Tesla makes a prototype of a battery the Vatican uses for drones you hang on to for unseen travel to send an unknown message. If Tesla makes the PI phone their messages could be encrypted and protected.And seeing with frequency. Not a fan.

Excited to share my latest article w. Yarin Eski in : The Tesla Case. We examined the social &amp; political consequences of smart surveillance by Tesla to explore how luxury surveillance works and its consumption by today’s aspirational class:
Please help to get this message across Elons Desk He Really must take them on The story will win.But NOT Tesla product adverts or PR.Bought space for Generic BEV education.Magnanimous
"Please Invest in generic consumer education advertising about the benefits of BEVs, not hybrids.  Do not even mention Tesla ( “published by”  in the credits only) the market will decide Please invest in FOC test drives collection from their homes and do it BIG."
"Whatever money Big Oil Spent on influencing the National narrative - They Have Won. Convincingly  “Tesla is no different - just more expensive” I checked in detail, The Mainstream Press they consumed was sufficiently varied and respected by them.    Spend big.."
That'll fuck up the government's revenue stream. Shame it will take 20 years.
Absolutely false and there are many sources of data that prove why.
Good to hear you’re on the mend ❤️‍🩹 take care and take it slower today. I have a feeling your girls and your wife will take care of making you slow down a little  😉
Looks nice.  Can we have the same in Switzerland?  We have a ton of similar dynamic speed limits and smart motorways (the hard shoulder becomes a working lane) and we risk tickets with the terribile map data today.

Once a station breaks even it should switch to FREE CHARGING for Tesla owners–other EVs can still pay to generate revenue. ICE owners will all switch to Tesla because of gas prices. Alt brands of EVs will see Tesla owners charging for free when charging and be jealous and switch!

Maybe if companies like Amazon and Tesla doubled or tripled their work force and then at the same time reduce the working hours of their workers to half or less than what it is now for the same pay. How big does your fucking yacht have to be?

"Tesla is aiming for 20m cars/year end of this decade.  With Elon time we'll recalculate not reaching that ambitious target &amp; say 14m cars. Still we have the same kind of journey as Apple had from 2012 until today.  Apple went up by 9x, Tesla will likely be heading a similar path."

The reason they wait with the Semi is because all the batteries they can get are put into 3 &amp; Y. While Tesla wait for more batteries they'll keep improving the Semi truck. It's already driving around for continuous improvement tests.
"In todays dollar value terms, not only through fiat dilution.  Tesla will sell each vehicle they produce. Why? Because they are battery constrained.  If model 3 &amp; Y market get temporarily saturated, they'll just put the batteries into the cybertruck &amp; Tesla Semi."
"Apple just continued producing, kept market share dominance &amp; kept high prices.  Only difference is marketing.  Tesla doesn't even have a PR department. Think about how well their sales will be if (when) they do get one.   Tesla will overtake Apple as the world's largest stock."
"Dear diary: Tesla is today similar to where Apple was 2012  Iphone had lots of hype, was mediocre the first iterations, Asian producers were caught up &amp; cheaper. Apple was up 10x from unveiling 2007 many thought it was done. 8x more just making new iterations.  Tesla will do same"

How about you opensourced paypal? And what about Tesla?
"Yeah. As a 2xMercedes, 2xBMW, 6 or 7 times VW owner, I know exactly what quality,reliability, durability look like. Oil leaking engines from Mercedes, complete roof interior trim dismantling at a 10k km BMW, broken DSGs from VWs, even the cup holders of VW didn't carry my mug. 💩"
Have they borrowed 😎 that design from Tesla?
"Not sure as you have the separate AP stalk. I imagine it would though, no harm in trying."
"Amazing all these people trying to justify Elons actions. Trying to give him an out when we he doesn’t have one. Just to keep Tesla stock in its lofty valuation. Keep dreaming, Twitter’s legal counsel know the ins and outs of Deleware Chancery court because they were heads of it"

"They provide accessibility to these that for all citizens, Tesla obviously pays for their energy directly &amp; funds billions into the gov via payroll, sales tax etc. The govt could not produce the same results as tesla or Space-x, so their “tasty” gov contracts are pretty deserved"
"Fair enough, if that was the intention of the tweet. But I have seen this video being used as a proof of Tesla’s superiority over Lucid. Different cars different make, definitely different target consumers. Move on."
Now do y=exp( stations) ... much more impressive!
Nope but I am a realist bro. And Tesla is not Elon but battery technology but if you want to hate on the guy. Go ahead.
NHTSA launches 37th investigation into Tesla after couple killed in crash
It's always hilarious to bump into this legacy finance bullshit while working in DeFi.
"Though if we’re going to speculate on this, I’d say it’s more to do with an excuse of wanting to liquidate Tesla stock without raising the alarms of shareholders (mostly higher ups in the company). Raising a stink w/ the Twitter deal will allow him to float under the radar."
I’ve only just got update 2022.16.3 - can’t wait for this version.

"When you switch AP on you are setting a ""max"" speed which it won't go above. So if you set 50 and the limit increases to 70 it won't change but if drops to 40 it will.  Top tip though, hold the right stalk down for a second and it will change to the current speed limit."

"If you allow the car wash to power from the tesla for 15 minutes, the car wash is free."
Ok that would be a factor if Elon didn’t waive due diligence. This is all a smokescreen because Elon doesn’t want to go through with the deal anymore given the value of Tesla stock rn

"VW group is leading in Europe, on a cumulative basis. Renault-Nissan is 2nd, Tesla is 3rd."

"Tesla delivered 80,000 cars in China in June"
This is going to cost Elon some of his billions but ultimately just hurt Tesla share price some more.
1. Lie about the current state of tech to fool people into believing that hoax products will ever arrive (see electric truck) thereby inflating value of Tesla “stock” (which does not pay dividends.) 2. Lie about buying twitter to excuse selling off  said stock. 3. Profit.
Tesla rediscovered the tech from the old world

"His ""stunt"" cost him and Tesla and Twitter stockholders money. He may be wealthy, however none of it is liquid. He couldn't raise a measly $44B in cash?  It isn't about the bots. Twitter opened the firehouse and gave him access to all the data. He doesn't know what to do with it."
"Twitter's owners *want* the deal to go through, the platform isn't profitable on its own and they'd rather have the bigass lump sum and let Elon('s people) deal with the mess of administrating the website. That's why Tesla stock tanked immediately in response to the deal."
"It’s actually bad that it’s in there in this form. People will use it, rely on it, and get points or even lose their license. Very bad PR for Tesla."
"I drove 10x more with my Tesla. Simply want to explore every unseen corner of the places I go. No cost, no tiring, why not see more."

Musk has come up with nothing. Tesla existed before he joined and became the hype man. He has done none of the innovating for any of his companies. He’s just the guy that owns the most shares and hypes them up. He is only a “genius” at marketing

Elon Musk’s Tesla no longer the world’s top seller of electric cars
"to my core i’m an elon musk hater like i get he’s somewhat innovative with tesla and i respect that, but as for the way he seems based on social media and public relations i legit cannot stand him. like just icky."
It’s like they underfunded the team designing it.
"Rumor has it that Bill Gates has a 500 Million short position against Tesla, I don't agree with Gates. In the expectatio…"
"I simply despise automakers attempts at software. They either over complicate things making the drivers experience miserable, or the software felt half assed like they did it in a hurry with no further thought. Some just look like a 2002 mp3 players OS."
"Tesla CEO  release the truth about the Twitter bid: ""It was practice. I need to learn how to pull out"""

I don’t think Tesla is having any problems selling their cars. If you order a model S right now you’re looking at at least a year to get delivery. All of these other models have huge backlogs as well. They can’t produce them fast enough.
Only any good for the rich not the average person
"paypal was founded by multiple billionaires and investors before musk joined  he's not a main  engineer at space X , he has a physics degree and an economics one, and hasn't invented anything in the company space X and tesla  is fueled by 7 billion dollars in government funding"
There’s so much nonsense about Tesla online. I try to set the record straight sometimes and go on a binge. I’ve got a great life thanks. Get back to commenting on moron tweets which is your level. You’re way out of your depth here.
my friend  's oc Steella and Tesla just promoting the eggman empire in the new eggkini XD
Will  offer a mirror delete when regulations permit?

Same for me! So close on the Tesla contest. Good Luck 💪💪
Haha. Dude. You clearly blew a fuse somewhere down the road. You sound like a lunatic.
"The USA, comparative to China, is far behind on the new vehicle sales front for Q1. All automakers, even Tesla, are struggling with the ongoing semiconductor shortages, and they started the month of June with desperately low inventories on dealer lots and in transit. (3/3)"
"Tesla did prove EVs were viable, but they’re no longer the leader in them. Tesla is a car built by a tech company, not an EV built by a car company. Their build can often be pretty shitty and trad’l car companies have caught up. Not worth the price, even outside of Elon as Elon"
Entrepreneur with anti-Tesla campaign fails in primary &gt;
Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk shared a meme soon after news emerged of the US-based social media platform Twitter hiring a law firm to sue the billionaire.🤔
Nice.
"What a concept, struggling families who can’t afford fuel, should buy a electric car! No better feeling than buying a tesla , when a tankful of gas is a major decision. Typical liberal concept when in dept spend more!!"
I haven’t flown since I bought my first Tesla. It was a condition I placed on myself to justify the purchase. Now holidays are all based around getting to spend time with my car 😂
"It's not Gud-Curry, its Gaddha-Gaadi. But he's also requesting Musk again n again to come n manufacture. I think he forgets the % of Indians who can actually afford a Tesla and also no of tesla sold in China in November &gt;&gt; No of luxury cars sold in India in 2021. Poor man!"
5) Tesla has super charging network. 6) Tesla have better software and OTA updates.
waiting for the tesla bossman  🥹
All Tesla Model S Dual Motor except plaid are nothing to Lucid Dual Motor! 🤣🤣🤣
"Owning a Tesla has already decreased my personal air travel. Any place I can drive to within about 9 hours I'd rather drive then deal with TSA, flight delays, rental cars etc. I often travel on my own time for work if I can drive instead of fly."
"Open up all the Tesla chargers across the UK for anyone to use, it makes sense if there sitting empty. I know a few are available but come on makes more money for musk to create more charging sites, win win."
Only ten years late….
"I doubt Lucid will, just because in the market they want to sell cars. The recession don´t hit that hard."
"He’s thinking how he wanted to fuck em off the Tesla, yes sir!"
NGHHHH TRUE 💔 PLEASE LEMME SEE MERLIN AGAIN. I NEED TO SEE TESLA DO DUMMY THICC DAMAGE AGAIN 😔😫
we all need   internet in our  ‘s  . please make a small car version Starlink version 🙌
1.6 kilometers to the mile.
"He's probably decided that it makes more financial sense to pay a termination cost, than seek massive leverage to overpay by +65% for a company with a Price/Earnings ratio +50% higher than Tesla's. It was a stupid offer to begin with."

"Mr. Zhang, elon needed a reason to sell tesla stocks, he sold over $8B with the excuse of buying twitter, it was always about selling and not making your shareholders mad rather than buying twitter"
"You lowered the value of Tesla and you are going to lose a billion, you really showed them."
"I think the real reason reason musk is not buying Twitter is because, the share Tesla dropped by a significant percentage when the news came that he is buying Twitter."
Austria
"So Elon snubs Tesla too when he drove a VW ID.3? It is Rivian EDV not DEV. It is laughable to say Canoo with one ex Tesla engineer 7 years ago has ""expertise"" in software, manufacturing, drive train, battery, car interior and exterior when they have built nothing yet."

"Yup, and he also recommended SOFI as well. He is just a one hit wonder. Look what’s happening to Tencent right now.  Probably sold all his Tesla too since he is not showing what he is currently holding."
"Exactly.  I mean if Tesla ownership isn't about ridiculing non-Tesla EV owners, then what are we even doing here??  The best thing we can do for Tesla is laugh at people."
"🚨🕸️ Trump during an event in Alaska late Saturday called Tesla CEO Elon Musk a “bullshit artist” for supporting the former president’s opponents in 2016 and 2020.  “He said the other day, ‘Oh, I’ve never voted for a Republican,’”"

"So Musk dumped a shitload of Tesla shares, using Twitter as an excuse. They simply don't come any more clever, cunning, or devious. That's why he's the folk hero of our time."
Many many happy returns of the day Nikola Sir
I’m on the Intelligent tariff and my Tesla didn’t charge again last night. Are you going to fix this? That’s three nights out of the last four
"Suddenly, I need a Tesla tomorrow😩"
"Yes, that tesla thing was attractive,  I might hav got to meet the man. But two years commissioning new 6 axis robots the facility is to be 95% Atonimous. Plus Grob wanted to combine Engineer s and Technitions."
He didn't drop anything   He put in a 44 billion offer and then pulled it back bc he wanted to see how many bots are on Twitter.   Also its not 44 billion in liquid currency.   Most of it is held in tesla stock
Neurallink and Tesla aren't the same companies 🤡s
Hope SEC will look into  dumping Tesla stock just before it went down.
Would be nicer if we could get rid of the wasted space to the right hand side. Yeah it’s cool seeing what the car sees but I’d much rather a larger map etc
Hopefully🤞🏼🤞🏼🤞🏼
That explains why you weren’t impressed. You developed garbage software. You were use to dated design. Go back to windows vista.
"Had A Great Weekend at the    Met so many great people and projects! On the last day we did an interview about Son Of Doge and the , soon available on YouTube! 📹   To finish the day we got a ride back on the Tesla Loop! Pretty cool 😎"
You guys just asked for this like a month ago and it’s already out LOL
"Since Musk's initial stake in Twitter was disclosed, Tesla stock has dropped down about 45%. The drop in Tesla has cost the CEO about $87 billion in wealth.  Weird flex, but ok."
It's a shame they are not Tesla Semis
scams on the fees. Kinda corrupt.
Make better content or im not buying a tesla
"It says: Friend Tesla, I send you a purported interview from the Record. This interview never took place, the reporter is a liar. Yours, Edison  (the Orange Record Transit Newspaper, NJ got its start in 1607 &amp; still runs today. Most likely this is the paper he refers to)"
Robo taxi is the first step of not owning your car that is the end goal for tesla! Eventually it will be cheaper to use a robo taxi!
was there a recent update and can tesla cars uninstall updates or revert?
"It says Friend Tesla I send you a purported interview from the Recorder.  This interview never took place, the reporter is a liar.  Yours Edison  I bet he dissed Tesla in the article😉"
"Why do you think it won’t be a good day..? Elon seems to be out of twitter deal, so it’s good news for Tesla holders or not?"
"All Tesla thinks, plans &amp; builds are EV's. Unlike the brand's ""transitioning"" to EV, for the past 17 yrs it's all Tesla has done. Their autonomous software is 2nd to none &amp; advancing that field responsibly. Projections aren't production, availability is reality, not your b.s.!"
if you want cars to become more like computers your getting the full package with software bugs included at lest there hasn't been a bug yet that bricks EV cars or the charging stations 😅or just crash
That’s to cut down on demand along with inflation adjustments. The money they are making to cut down on demand is temporary. Dropping the cost or just giving everyone free stuff temporarily isn’t fair for potential future and previous buyers.
Now find suitable buyer for Tesla...sale it and go to Himalaya for penance..and don't do such stupidity in future...
Mine did this - but it doesn’t keep the new speed - it gets overridden again by GPS half a mile later…
"When more convenient demand for miles will at least double. You can basically work in a tesla, have lunch at a great place 4h away and be back at home at 5. While all working from Tesla. Much better than work from home."
What’s the logic for the car actually adjusting speed for changing limits?  I’ve seen it adjust in the past - sometimes. But not all the time.  Is there an official word on it?
No... Elon does alotta his PR for SpaceX &amp; Tesla on twitter...
"Electrify America has certainly made progress, more than I’d realized.  But, their coverage still doesn’t match Tesla’s."
Tesla model s I can get it is in the same day as a manufacturing company although I do not have a time for the single person to be white.
"I'm not a fan, but gloating always goes bad. The Tesla cars are causing rolling blackouts by over using the electricity from a coal powered grid. See... there is goes"

"I don't believe that, especially considering their many price increases."
"And as you said, quality! How are they going to also fund that while paying all the employees they have? Model S and X do need a new factory don’t they? Where is the funding coming from? Maybe you can take a load of money from the stock market…"
"News flash….we all knew about the bots…why would he sign a contract without due diligence? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Good luck with those Tesla sales now."
Tbh we hadn't noticed the tesla chargers until after we'd plugged in they are in a different car park altogether!
Yo Elon can I have a free Tesla
thing is that tesla stock is in correction period
Maybe  wants to offer HoboNickels to buy a Tesla? This would be funny 😝   😺 🦄
"Ridiculous Elon, low customer use.  Tesla Australia cuts standard home charging cable from new cars"
"I really don’t care why he bails, only that he does bail. Whether it’s because he sees that it was a stupid deal or he simply tired of the joke, either one is fine with me. I just know I will never buy a Tesla."
"There aren’t enough Model S sales to continue to fund both the cars, all their employees, the factories, and the software and hardware engineering team. That comes mostly from the Model 3/Y. But even then, getting more cash out of that still help a lot."
12 hour trip for 672 miles. That is similar to crossing the whole of Germany from south to north. Sounds ok to me.  I am guessing Tesla isnt the only provider of charging stations in the US.
how do they decide that driver losing one is not sloppy or slow or less skilled. do they do this race with random 300 drivers around the world and show the average result. may be most ppl who like tesla can also sabotage or subconsciously don’t want others to go ahead. 😂😂😂
He doesn’t have that time.
🤣🤣🤣  Not if your shit's powering it  *motions to Tesla's malfunctions*
We all know you never intended of buying Twitter. You used it as an excuse to sell of a bunch of inflated Tesla stocks which you know will drop in price.
And here is the response from three WFP that gave him exactly what he asked for.   I'll take my apology in the form of Tesla.

"Tanking your own company's stock because you can't keep your mouth shut is lol. That's a ton of shareholder value gone.  Tesla wasn't profitable for over a decade. It's successful, sure, but only in the last couple of years."
"The purchase price of the car pays for the software, it's not that hard to understand. I've heard these exact same arguments around why videogames should have microtransactions and they're both full of shit. This is purely an additional revenue stream for the company, &amp; it's bad."

So the tri motor lucid is going to be the same price as the dual motor? I’m not sure I follow. Or are you saying that whatever price the tri motor lucid ends up being it’ll beat the tesla? Then why bring up price?

They don’t care. It’s just another cause they can rally themselves behind because they’re not agreeing with the current agenda. Next time it’s something like lowering the speed limit. They’ll probably say bill gates works for Tesla or smth.
"Elon musk can taste my fat toes, he is a bitch and I hate him, also fuck tesla. Ever wonder why the police, firemen, ambulance drivers never drive electric cars? The UK tried electric police cars and they failed miserably. 🖕🖕🖕 SUCK MY DICK ELON"

But miles are taken from legacy ICE vehicles that got getired not from new Tesla EV fleet.

Elon managed to sell Tesla on stock on the pretext that he is using the proceeds to buy Twitter without tanking Tesla stock.  That kind of worked ok for him …

???  Nonsense.   Twitter isn’t important in the grand scheme of things.   Tesla’s success is not correlated with anything at/with Twitter.
"It’s not greed, this helps fund the team working on the software. Tesla has about 800 employees working on both Software and hardware along with Labelors. That’s ~+100M a year. Selling the car itself does not pay for all of that."

Now that I drive electric it's much cheaper to get around. I actually find I'm driving a lot more than I used to. Tesla make road trips easy and the guilt of causing more pollution has gone. I think it's EVs that will increase miles driven. Autonomy goes hand in hand with that.

Go look at the history of Tesla and SpaceX. Both nearly destroyed him financially. It was due to his leadership that they made it. Most other CEOs would have bailed first chance they got.
He played chess here everyone thought it's bad move but it's not. He made everyone fool. Buying twitter was never on plate 1. He took money out of Tesla by selling huge numbers of shares at the top for tax and for liquidity to buy in low without making any retail investor angry
No expert but isn’t that for the Tesla Board of Directors to decide?
"Excuses. Facts do indeed matter. What were they doing from 2009-2018?  They first wasted time on a hybrid, bc they had not clue how to do EVs.   How many people did Tesla have when they built the Roadsters?   Tesla did not have 9 yrs to sit on their laurels tinkering in a garage."

I still doubt Tesla would let EV owners register into Robo Taxi Fleet. They might keep that market share to themselves because there is no competition for FSD. It is also easy to manage the business this way.

"Well, I'm sure Tesla would be willing to share the % of car sales that are from selling real physical cars or fake CGI generated cars?"

I would buy a tesla model s plaid and sell it then buy a tesla model Y lr+ and buy some accessories for the car
Major oof that's a bigger drop than Tesla's stock.
I don’t follow him either. But I do care when he thought about buying Twitter.  Proved that he was bored with Tesla.   I read the Boring Co. isn’t doing very well either.   Makes you wonder if he is just a young version of Trump and everything he touches eventually turns to shit.
my dad getting Tesla I want Cadillac CT5
Same stupid shit like “buy $TSLA not Tesla”

Elon i want buy tesla motor for my boat. Help me ❤️
True. This is what makes this Tesla Twitter family so special.
Hey  why don't you buy  instead of  now most of it is own by the south Korean Hyundai .... that's a big chunk of American technology seems like it would be a great acquisition for   I'd buy a Spot Model Plaid 🤷🤷 Just saying 🙂🙂

"$TWTR -Social media platform seeks to force the Tesla boss to go through with his takeover... Elon Musk faces uphill battle for victory in Twitter legal fight, experts say"
Kool Elton John Elon Musk my friend…. Tesla?
I haven't been in a Lucid but I share the same views. I love the minimalistic yet elegant style of a Tesla.
"It’s not about the amount of money in the world. Inflation is driven by higher demand than supply. If a Tesla car costs $100K and everyone is billionaire, everyone can afford it which drives demand and supply can’t keep up which in turn the car price will have to increase."
Tesla obviously
"Sure you can lol  He made his money by sheer luck: he was at PayPal early and had a ton of stock even though they fired him   Also, almost his entire wealth is paper: it's all Tesla stock. And he bought Tesla, he didn't found it.  It's easy to make money if you start with money"
Good afternoon. Please tell me when you plan to release an electric ATV with an excellent range and power like Tesla.
Tesla settles w. customers whose cars went up in flames only after they sign a nondisclosure statement. Musk is doing everything he can to hide that his cars are burning up at a high rate. He's untrustworthy &amp; emotionally a child.
Lies 😂 Dems practically phuck their Tesla cars before bed each night
If Elon was serious in the first place he would have done his homework. Who offers 44 billion for a company without knowing every detail about the operation of that company?  He did that to increase the price of stocks in Tesla or for publicity. He has something up his sleeve. 👍
"Yes, please! I've sacrificed my face :o"
Just wanted to avoid any hassle.
Ah then yeah😬
Elon Musk responds with laughing meme to Twitter lawsuit over broken buyout
28 hours? Is that a joke hope so… I recharge at night so no I spent no minute at a fucking gasoline station! Gasoline cars are crap!
Battery life is a huge disadvantage． Especially Tesla's batteries are very expensive
"Great info. I’ve been thinking about getting one for my wife, as the Tesla is too “tech heavy” for her. Maybe I’ll hold off for a bit longer. Thank you!!"

Tesla talks with Samsung for camera modules: report -
Yeah but it’s also how often they see them. Plus will be in Canada for a couple weeks
"Tesla will make every single car it sells, with a 30%+ margin, until probably... 2028? At least. Maybe longer if it can't scale as fast as it desires to. 50% YoY growth minimum goals, and no reason to doubt the claim so far. No demand worries for Tesla buddy lmao"
White House Announces Tesla Will Open Its Supercharger Network
"And as soon as they were in the dark under their blankets, pressing their faces cheek to cheek in utter silence, Tesla knew that Einstein's feelings for her had not faded. Even after being by her side for decades."
The infrared laser beams that control the start times of official NHRA tracks would disagree with you.

Why Musk’s Twitter acquisition bid maybe a ploy to sell $8.5bn in Tesla stock   via  It looks pretty transparent that he beneifitted every which way but twitter employeess have had nothng but anxiety  &amp; instability Seems he is SI inept?
"It should be fine, since you are out of state and you don’t live in that state. Plus it’s legal in all 50 states"

"So as Elon isn’t buying Twitter now, Tesla employees can go back to do nothing."
Maybe  can hook up Tesla Mega Packs to the grid. Too bad he used up all the electricity with the smoke screen Cyber Rodeo.
To quote my friend Sara: Every asshole I know drives a Tesla.
"Right? I'm a Libertarian anyways, and frankly care more about the economy than social policy BS anyways, so I'm buying the most American-made car that'll last me the longest and make the most sense... oh, hey, that's a Tesla coincidentally 😂"

NHTSA launches 37th investigation into Tesla after couple killed in crash:   Comments:
Always 2 to 3 steps back.  And you think you know so much about the supply chain when you obviously have no clue that batteries itself is a limiting factor until I told you.  And on top of that you look down on us Tesla investors thinking we know nothing.  The opposite is true.
The nose of the Plaid looks like it is further across the start than the nose of the Air.
Sergio shares his opinion a lot on Twitter (a lot I disagree). But he’s right. There is nothing that makes (currently not existent) CT tow further than the F-150 when the lightning has had towing tests that shown it gets 130-150m  Coming from a Tesla owner before it’s called bias
"Angry, he blows up his broken down Tesla"
That’s funny since he didn’t unload any Tesla shares since his disclosed sale in April
"Then now Ford says they want to spend 20b in acquiring up to 240gwh of batteries.  Remember, that's just the same amount Tesla is planning in each of their gigafsctoree.  Tesla is thinking in terms of TWHs.  This is where you'll see legacy keep making annkuncenents that are..."
"Right to free speech ends where the rights of someone else start. Also Elon Musk ""Imma pretend to buy Twitter, so I can buy more cheap Tesla stock. lol."", bit of a loose quote but you get the idea."

"He is a crook,he used the pretext of buying  to sell a bulk of his shares in Tesla while it was  peak @ 760$ when he did that and collected billions of $$ the share now is 400 something $ he will buy it again 300$ cheaper than what he bought it,Twitter deal was a scam"
"Not really.  Failed at math in school?  Surprising for a Tesla proponent.  The surface area required to support charging for 100% EV usage is enormous - don't forget larger charging stalls for maintenance vehicles, trucks, etc.  Enjoying the collapse of Elon's paper empire?"
"- The END Is Near: Tesla Wins, Apple DESPERATE, Legacy Auto F’d.  NEW   $TSLA"
"1st, legacy tells you tesla is stupid for trying to make their own batteries.  Then they see how hard it is to get em, all of them are now rushing to build their own plants.  Then you see them planning on 20gwh to 40gwh plants when Tesla is already in the 200 to 300 gwh per plant"

"What about putting a safety feature where if it detects someone sitting in seat, the climate control stays on to prevent deaths by heat in Teslas?"
"He leveraged Tesla to take out a loan to buy Twitter, so being forced to buy Twitter at a low for Tesla stock could cause him to lose control of Tesla because he'd have to sell more shares, and then to make up part of the loss he'd have to sell off a decent chunk of Twitter"

How many poor and unfortunate people benefits from Elon Musk? Not many. Avg. Tesla buyer is households with more than 160k yearly income. But Mark Cuban benefits poor by reducing their medicine prices.

Get ready for a subpeona when the lawyers figure out you're an independent contractor for a Tesla shell company paid for by Tesla marketing.
"Even when  Tesla is ONLY a car company, the fact that your flawed assumptions on legacy being able to secure as much batteries as tesla will crash your entire model. This has already been probing out for legacy. This is why you keep seeing delays after delays in legacy."
My favorite is that some financial experts looked at the penalty for withdrawing the deal being a 1 billion dollar penalty meanwhile Musk liquidated 8.5 billion from Tesla right as Tesla becomes ineligible for certain government subsidies
Lol tesla is failing too
This update is for the people with FSD or for all Tesla driver‘s available?
"Are you still recommending people short Tesla? Move on, you lost a long time ago darling. Time to become a professional."
"That is when its not sitting, broken, in a service center."
Green Hydrogen will Vanish  in next 10 years and that's the reason  is not happy with this idea.
"Another huge fundamental flow is your assumption that legacy can acquire or be as good as Tesla when it comes to the limiting factor, batteries.  In fact, the very idea that you think VW will overtake Tesla in 2 years shows how ridiculous that is."
"He’s one of the richest people alive, you really think he’d have to tap into his Tesla stock to pay off some fees? 😂"
"It's a complete cover-up, diversion, and manipulation for what is really going on. It's another attention grab similar to what he did with Tesla. Musk is even in trouble with the SEC for the same reasons as to why he was with the $420 deal."
New tesla update
Yeah but I’m getting a Tesla so Tesla vibes lmfao
"😅 that would be the biggest waste of electricity, the efficiency is 88-93%, rest of it turns to heat  on a phone for example wireless degrades your smartphone battery faster than wired charging  they could put charging at stop lights, so the 3 people in a line charges up"
"arcing is power LOSS, and Tesla's original magnifying transmitter designs were extremely well tuned to AVOID arcing, to push as much energy into the electric fields as possible, which  is doing here  im REALLY excited to see people actually demonstrate this effect"
"social token to back up mission for TESLA, no?  dunno, Im not convinced by your arguement."
Why does the Tesla get a bit of a head start?
"Gull wing doors, flush handles, panarama roof, all stolen from prior generation gas guzzlers.  Being too expensive for a basic interior and unreliable? Also stolen from 1980s Maserati."
Pretty interesting graphic on where  employees go after leaving 🚘
So Elon will have to waste time prepping for court instead of focusing on Tesla?
She won't if she found Tesla spacex PayPal boring etc
Check it out on the way back.
"Agreed. I was at a supercharger recently and a truck driver stopped me to chat and was curious what I knew about the  semi. He has heard all the specs but said “I’m from the show me state, so they’re gonna have to show me before I believe it.”"
absolutely beautiful demonstration of how Tesla's wireless power transmission worked. you know this is a genuine attempt and not fraud because you can't see the coil arcing *at all* except accidentally at one point
"Nikola Tesla loved a bird  “Yes, I loved that pigeon, I loved her as a man loves a woman, and she loved me.” Elon has an on again off again relationship with  Twitter"
"They wanted you to buy twitter, hence the lawsuit. Does anyone actually not think this was a way for you to both sell tesla stock and distract from negative press? Like is anyone actually dickriding that hard that they don't see what this very plainly is?"
"The modern woman, who anticipates in merely superficial phenomena the advancement of her sex, is but a surface symptom of something deeper and more potent fermenting in the bosom of the race  Women will ignore precedent and startle civilization with their progress  - Nikola Tesla"

"So, yeah, bottomline,  if you think Tesla is no more than just a car company or putting a low possibility on that, and that you believe teslas are just cara with an electric drive train and not a computer on wheels will be your undoing."
You didn’t pick winners from the tesla KMs  GAME

No he wouldn't
"This statement makes no sense. Before the car has not recognized a sign, it cannot react to it. Slow down far before a sign, then we are back to signs that come from the GPS."
Serious question - doesn't Elon/Tesla own like a gazillion of bitcoin? He could be forced to sell if he is in serious financial peril. Why are you enthusiastic about this?

I think Tesla stock plummeted because it was a moronic idea.
"That’s not true …   pulls power if your battery goes below a certain percentage  … also if your battery is cold. Interestingly, your Tesla will also complain if you keep trying to charge 100% . So the range quoted isn’t the actual range you’ll get … EVER"

You should have done some due diligence before shooting your mouth off about buying Twitter at a specified price..obviously had an impact on the share price of Twitter and Tesla. Your wanting to put consciousness on mars doesn't mean that you aren't accountable for anything else.

Why on earth a company should share its data openly?? Which company does that?😂 such a logically weak argument. Will Tesla share all the videos and data points it collects from their cars? Never! Twitter is no different.

"any possible way to integrate starlink and Tesla’s FSD architecture into one system, giving the FSD system a wider range of eyes?(satellite)  $MOOO"
Broooooooo congrats
"He's genuinely intelligent, but also wealthy enough to abuse anything outside his narrow scope of intelligence. Less tesla, more Edison."
Can we get air quality AQI sensors on the Cybertruck?  . . .
"You fail again. I'm not going to take you seriously anymore. Not unless you show me your Tesla, Solar panels or an actual RoboTaxi that is already on the road. Until then, your all talk"
Ha! Were literally down the street at the in laws. Juiced at that atation multiple times last time we drove down 😂. Great weather today!
Someone start a rumor this is all because of Elon musk and his Tesla migration to Texas!
And u not getting TWITTER NIGGA ILL TAKE DAT AND YO TESLA JUS CRASHED THASS THA BOARD

"Who suggested the name, ""Tesla""?"
sheeeesh i know who i'm askin to pick me up next time i fly out :)
Elon Musk replied to   $TSLA
"I would love to see Tesla or any big company for that matter, start converting unused office buildings into homeless shelters."
"FWIW - the more likely result of Musk walking away from the deal will be Tesla stock going up by 20% or more. The debt he was taking on, coupled with the distraction of Twitter and especially his likely need to liquidate more of his Tesla shares was a huge drag on share price."
Still waiting on you to invest some of that 44B in a soccer team in Texas… We can get a stadium built and make this happen. We are hosting the 2026 World Cup and the Final could be playing at the Tesla Stadium. Think about it
Compare by age of vehicle and it is a different story
"Elon approached them and named his number.  He was never serious about buying Twitter, only about manipulating the market.  He, and everybody else, knew about bots on Twitter. He uses them himself.  He's losing money on Tesla, and made enemies of Democrats who were buying Teslas"
How am I supposed to charge my Tesla?
"I'm going to refuse my Tesla and demand my $250 back because Elon didn't disclose how many poor panel gaps I'd get.  Sure, I knew the car would have them, and the car still works as advertised, as did Elon."
Nice! 😍
Is Tesla for real?
Keep telling yourself that
"1/  Investigation of a similar 2015 Model fatal crash:  ""Tesla emphasized that Autopilot ""is an assist feature that requires you to keep your hands on the steering wheel at all times... you need to maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle while using it.""   CONT -&gt;"
Tesla will have more Tesla bots than twitter by 2025 😂
Give me my Tesla plz
"In the name of progress, Tesla plays with road safety"
Tesla CEO  has announced since that he will gift me Tesla Model Y.
"Muskateer he-he-he posts are bizarre given $TSLA's mission statement says:  ""Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the better.""  I guess somehow Muskateers turned that into  ""ha ha other EVs suck!😂"""

Tesla CEO  has announced he’s pulling out of the deal to fill up the bags of Doritos all the way in a letter to the $Pep board
I would have cut him off a month ago if I were Twitter. Without Twitter Tesla never would have been $100 stock. It’s coming.
"He's just using that it as cover now that Twitter's value looks like $15-20 billion and Tesla stock is down 40%, but even if he weren't he didn't write that into the terms to exit the deal without the penalty."
Point is you claimed global pandemic and supply chain shortages is blame when many other smaller EV companies produced and have delivered.   CyberTruck won't even deliver in 2023 just like Tesla Semi won't go into production the same year.
I didnt call him a liar. He was extremely unclear about who purchased it whether it was transfered to the university and when the plan on building anything on it. I definitely believe someone has 500 acres somewhere east of the tesla factory.
true true.
prob would’ve been like $60 last year lol

"when apple and tesla's biggest manufacturing base are in China and their supply chain also heavily rely on Chinese suppliers? If you don't know, google Apple's supplier list."
"This is not an apt comparison, the performance boost upgrade is more akin to a paid driver update as it controls hardware functions. It is not reasonable for it to cost money, and it is something we should oppose because it fucking sucks for consumers and shouldn't be normalized."
"Correct. When Morgan found out energy generated would be for free, he blew his temper, &amp; warned his rich friends to never ever invest in Tesla"
He put his tesla shares up as security  witch says if he can't pay the loan the bank gets his shares in tesla and their dividends and they can then sell them   so effectively the bank owns tesla collateral till he pays off the loan
The only MOD my tesla will ever get 😎👻⚡️🏎

"I own a Tesla but Elon shouldn’t have been in the running as the arbiter of public discourse. Twitter has to have common sense censorship in place to prevent abuse from racists, nazis and anti-lgbtq people. Preventing misinfo, disinfo and malinfo is what twitter is doing."
"""Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.""—Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856- 7 Jan 1943)"
I am disappointed he is backing out on the deal but in the end when you look at the things he supports they all point towards building a world he wants to live in.  I give him credit for that.  I love his spacex projects.  Don't like EV's but I love the tesla bot idea.
I'm waiting for the Tesla motorbike.
hey greg hows your new tesla
Go look at the influence Uber had over high level government officials and tell me with a straight face that Tesla didn't pull similar games to keep the regulators away from their BS self-driving tech.

He has Quinn Emanuel &amp; other partners representing him — as an individual.  This is not Tesla. Was in the news earlier.
"This is to qualify for Biden's $7 billion infrastructure program.  Mentioned by the White House, not a peep from Tesla about the upgrades they are doing to allow non-Tesla owners to recharge at their Superchargers."
Batteries are good for 1 mil km and are recycled at the EOL. Most of parts in Li-Ion and especially in latest Tesla LFP (which last 4-5x longer) are recyclable. By the time of wider EV adoption it shouldn’t be an issue.
". FSD allows you to focus on the macro components of driving. Manual driving is exhausting because you have to also focus on the micro components (staying centered in lane with small steering wheel movements, accelerating smoothly pedal pushes, etc)"
"I liquidated my Tesla shares under the guise of a takeover of Twitter which I planned to submarine from the start. I will whine and complain all the way down.  Your move SEC. This pawn is really a king trust me, would I lie? Now where is an employee, I need to get my in vitro on."
Uhhh…. Where can we get answers to Tesla issues?
The banks don't loan against tesla stocks to give each person on earth 5 billion $   elon did not have 44billon$ he borrowed  44 billions   theirs a diffance in networth and liquid assets his networth he can borrow against but he dose not have that in cash
Elon Musk  would you focus on Tesla now not Twitter  !!!! 🤦😒
"Pre 2015 yes. Pre 2015 Chinese people don't want to buy Chinese cars, or Chinese home appliance, but in 2022 when even Apple and Tesla rely on the Chinese supply chain? Not any more. Google Apple's supplier list and see how many Chinese suppliers are there."
board should seriously move to strip you if control to this company. You’re dangerous

"Speaking of no-AM-radio-in-a-Tesla, radio in general, especially AM, is just not on peoples radar anymore. Kind of like Apple phasing out DVD drives and headphone jacks."

Those 3 companies have only delivered less than 30k EV’s in the last couple years. Where as Tesla is well over a million so it’s hard to compare them in that way. Either way Tesla seems to be doing great as the forerunner of EV’s and it’s not been an easy nut to crack.
